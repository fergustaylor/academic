  **About Me:** Hello, I'm Fergus. From August 2019-2021, I’ll be completing the Academic Foundation Programme in Ninewells. Research block: April - August 2021.
  <br><br>
  **Opportunities:** I'm always keen to help collaborate/teach/learn something new, and over the next 2 years I'm sure I'll need help with projects too. If you're interested get in contact and if I've got anything to advertise I'll place a link here.
