**About Me:** I’m a Foundation Dr in Dundee with a passion for Global Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery. From August 2019-2021 I’ll be completing the Academic Foundation Programme in Ninewells. 

**Opportunities:** I'm always keen to help collaborate, and over the next 2 years I'm sure I'll need help with projects too. If you're interested, I'll place a notice here.

Feel free to send me a message if you've got any questions.
You can look up my email directly via dundee.ac.uk. or NHS.net.
