Elective surgical patients are required to fast, in order to reduce the risk of pulmonary
aspiration of gastric contents [1]. For multiple reasons, many patients
fast for longer than recommended. Prolonged fasting has many detrimental
effects; including dehydration, electrolyte imbalances and hypoglycaemia, as
well as exacerbating the postoperative stress response [2]. Furthermore, protracted
fasting is also unpleasant for patients and can induce distress and fatigue.
A previous audit in our hospital showed that elective breast surgery
patients were fasting for excessive periods. A new fasting guideline and patient
information sheet has since been introduced across our health board. We sought
to determine if this new guideline and staff education have improved the duration
of pre-operative fasting in elective breast surgery patients in our hospital.

Methods:

Over a five-week period, a re-audit was conducted on elective breast surgery
patients. Patients were interviewed to determine their fasting times for food
and clear fluids, and what information they had received on fasting.

Results:

Data were collected for 24 elective breast surgery patients. The mean fasting
time for food was 15 h 10 min (range 8 h 50 min to 21 h 5 min); [previous
data 15 h 24 min (range 11 h 0 min to 21 h 30 min)]. The mean fasting time
for clear fluids was 8 h 35 min (range 1 h 5 min to 16 h 20 min); [previous
data 13 h 13 min (range 3 h 10 min to 19 h 15 min)]. Twenty patients recalled
being instructed to fast from food, as of midnight, and clear fluids from 6 am or
6.30 am. Four patients stated that they had been advised to fast entirely from
midnight. Twenty patients recalled being given written information on fasting,
whereas ten patients received written and verbal information. Two patients
received only verbal information.

Discussion:

From this re-audit it is evident that elective breast surgery patients in our centre
are continuing to fast for excessive periods, although slightly less than previously.
Disappointingly, patients allocated to the afternoon list were told to fast
from midnight, and did not all receive water on the ward in the morning.
Although not measured here, this may be having harmful affects on their postoperative
recovery. Alarmingly, two patients were given written information to
fast completely from midnight, despite this not being on the new patient information
leaflet. An improvement in fasting practices has been seen following
introduction of the new guidelines and patient information leaflets. Further staff
education is required to ensure the correct information is disseminated to
patients to enable additional progress to be made.
