**About Me:** I’m a Glasgow medical student with a passion for Global Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery. From August 2019 I'll be working as an Academic Foundation Doctor in Dundee.

I'm interested in quality improvement in healthcare, and I’ve worked on a few research projects as a student. I’m currently learning how to use more data science tools with R. (.. d3.js and HTML).

Next I’ll work on LaTex, Python and SQL.

I tend to use private repositories on Github when I’m working, and make them public once I’ve cleaned up the code - especially when I’m using public datasets. But if there’s something I can share here while I’m going along, I do at least try to post explanations of what I’m working.

All the code should be reproducible from Github and the data sources marked out in my scripts. These projects show some examples of work I’m interested in at the moment.
